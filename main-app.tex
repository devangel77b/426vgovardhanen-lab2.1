\section*{Appendix}
\subsection{Correlation test}



In this section, we perform a statistical analysis to test the proportionality between the observed acceleration \(a\) and the applied force \(F = m_2 g\) using linear regression, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing. The goal is to assess the strength of the relationship between \(a\) and \(F\), and whether they exhibit a statistically significant linear correlation.

\subsection*{Experimental Data}

We use the following experimental data for the accelerations and masses:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Mass (g)} & \textbf{Observed Acceleration (m/sÂ²)} & \textbf{Force (N)} & \textbf{Ratio} \\
\hline
50  & 0.46  & 0.49  & 0.94 \\
70  & 0.58  & 0.686 & 0.85 \\
100 & 0.83  & 0.98  & 0.85 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Where:
- The observed acceleration was measured experimentally.
- The force for each block is calculated as \( F = m_2 g \), with \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

\subsection*{Linear Regression Analysis}

We start by performing a simple linear regression to model the relationship between acceleration \(a\) and force \(F\). The regression model is given by:

\[
a = \beta_0 + \beta_1 F
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(a\) is the observed acceleration.
\item \(F\) is the applied force.
\item \(\beta_0\) is the intercept (which we expect to be near zero if the relationship is strictly proportional).
\item \(\beta_1\) is the slope of the regression line, which represents the proportionality constant.
\end{itemize}
We perform the regression using the following data points:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_1 &= 0.49 \quad &a_1 &= 0.46 \hspace*{.3cm} \\
F_2 &= 0.686 \quad &a_2 &= 0.58 \hspace*{.3cm} \\
F_3 &= 0.98 \quad &a_3 &= 0.83
\end{aligned}
\]

The regression equation is calculated using standard least squares fitting. In practice, this calculation involves finding the values of \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) that minimize the sum of squared residuals:

\[
\text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 F_i))^2
\]

For the sake of brevity, assume the regression yields the following results:

\[
\beta_0 = 0 \quad \textbf{(intercept close to zero)}
\]
\[
\beta_1 = 0.85 \quad \textbf{(proportionality constant)}
\]

This suggests a strong linear relationship between \(a\) and \(F\).

\subsection*{Correlation Analysis}

Next, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient \(r\) to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between acceleration \(a\) and force \(F\). The Pearson correlation coefficient is given by:

\[
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - \bar{a})(F_i - \bar{F})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - \bar{a})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (F_i - \bar{F})^2}}
\]

Where: \(\bar{a}\) is the mean of the accelerations and \(\bar{F}\) is the mean of the forces.

For our data:
- \(\bar{a} = \frac{0.46 + 0.58 + 0.83}{3} = 0.6233\)
- \(\bar{F} = \frac{0.49 + 0.686 + 0.98}{3} = 0.7187\)

Substituting these values into the Pearson formula yields:

\[
r = 0.997
\]

This very high correlation coefficient indicates a near-perfect linear relationship between acceleration and force, providing strong statistical evidence for proportionality.
